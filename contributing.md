## I just have a question

For questions, please open a discussion on the [Github Discussion](https://github.com/micziz/heaterdom/discussions). DO NOT OPEN AN ISSUE AS IT WILL BE CLOSED

## Before you contribute

Keep in mind that the philosophy of the project is to be minimal and transparent. Keep this in mind when contributing.

## Reporting your first Bug

One way of contributing is by reporting bugs! Here is a small guide to reporting issues! 

Before opening a new issue, please check if there are similar issues.

### Getting information

First, determine from where the bug is coming from. Get detailed information about the bug, as well as version numbers. MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON THE LATEST VERSION. Note that there are two branches. `main` and `develop`. If you encounter a bug in `develop`, please check if it exists in `main`. `develop` is not meant to be stable.

### Reporting your first suggestion

The chosen issue tracker is [Github Issues](https://github.com/micziz/heaterdom/issues). Fill in the required template. Here are some good tricks to help you make a better bug report.

- Use a **clear** and descriptive **title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- Describe the **exact** steps which reproduce the problem. Make sure you include the cli options, and how it started... Be as detailed as possible. Remember: don't just say **what** you did, but explain **how** you did it
- Explain which behavior you **expected** to see instead and **why**.
- (IF POSSIBLE) Include **screenshots** and animated **GIFs**

Also, make sure you answer these questions:

- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If no, describe how many times it affects you.
  
Remeber to also add configuration details, and version numbers like (depending on what seems necessary):

- Python version (python3 --version or python --version)
- Pip version (pip3 --version or pip --version)
- Heaterdom version (use python3 main.py --help or --version)
- Traceback and python error.

## Suggesting a feature

If you see as if heaterdom is missing a feature, you can suggest a feature.

Before suggesting anything, look at the TODO in the readme, and see if it's already planned.

Also, make sure to check that the feature was not already suggested.

### Making your first suggestion

To suggest a new feature, create a discussion from [Github Discussion](https://github.com/micziz/heaterdom/discussions).
